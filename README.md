# My personal website: source files

---

It's my personal website developed by using a python tool named **[Streamlit
](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit)**.
--- 

- I tried to implement some of **Clean Architecture** patterns as much as it's possible here.

P.S. Don't judge too quickly :) I've spent few hours for making it. In the first day when I got know **Streamlit**.

To run just use ``python main.py``
